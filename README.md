## Purpose

This is a set of various [InvokeBuild](https://github.com/nightroman/Invoke-Build) tasks that do generic task/automation work.

For setting up a project, having some nice tasks setup like this can increase velocity and ease of standardization, formatting, and more.

Tasks can include items such as:

- Formatting go, powershell
- Docker build for codespaces
- build a markdown page containing details on tasks for references
- bootstrap a projects documentation layout
- install powershell module dependencies
- cleanup artifacts
- generic build notifications for github, datadog, teams, slack or whatever else gets added.


## Why InvokeBuild

The short answer is it's a pretty powerful framework for running tasks and has proven to be extremely reliable for me.
It's also relatively easy to quickly extend once you work through understanding how it works.

Long term I probably will explore more, but for now this provides a rapid productivity gain in a project to improve local development workflow.
